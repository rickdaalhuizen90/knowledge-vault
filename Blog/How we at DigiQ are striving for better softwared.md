# How we at DigiQ are striving for better software

We don't believe in creating highly stressed environments, neither do we strive for unobtainable standards and perfections. We don't want to anticpate in toxic environments. Having these circumstance in your company rather means it's a failure of higher management and the way we build software.

We live in an competitive field where everything have to build perfect in a short matter of time and cheap as possible. While this sounds good, it's nearly impossible to achieve perfection in all of them. Making promises that we can't live by, setting tight deadlines leads to bad software, unhappy developers and customers.

So how can we build good products without having tight deadlines, misseriable working conditions and still stay in budget?

By tackeling the lifecycle of a product. Having a seamless production process and using the right tool to build them. That's why we invest a large proportion of our time in tuning and researching the best way to achieve that.

Some focus points are

-   Prototyping & Design, most of software failures can be prevented by spedding more time in prototyping and having a good design before actualy building it
-   Having a good MVP product and design reduce development time a lot
-   Having better time estimations when there's a clear path what has to be done
-   Train our developers to have the right skills for the job, we don't expect that our developers know everything.
-   Transparancy to the customer
-   No bulshit, we don't overpromise.
-   Have a tight QA process so bugs don't end up in production
-   Having the right tools to do our work, can we reduce development time with 10% or even 30% if we choose software X over software Y

The internet becomes oversaturated with bad software. Faster and Cheaper is not always better. There are a lot of bad software companies that call them self expertise. We see software as a craftman ship. We love code, and we love creating things.

How we build software of the future

Where we really difference with others is our passion for the latest technologies that is out there. We are a tech company, and we love new technology. We not limit our self with that technolgy that's out there now but we try to be earlt addopters of the bleeding edge technolgy that will gain popularity from 5 or even 10 years from now. Technolgy is changing rapidly and we don't want to fall behind. Usign bleeding edge technolgy makes it possible to build thing for our customers that reallt can differate them in the market. Som early addoptions we want to strive in is AR,Machine learning and conversional bots (we don't like to use the word AI but that's a whole difference kind of topic)

## Numbers
Unlike other languages, Javascript only has one type of number. It not only includes number like 1 or 1.2, but also includes NaN and Infinity.

## Strings
Strings are literal values in Javascript.

`console.log(typeof 'foo')`

`console.log(typeof "foo");`

`console.log(typeof`foo`);`

-   Javascript implicitly converts other types of values into string by concatenating them.
-   Strings are literal values in Javascript.

## Booleans

Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values : true and false

If you pass undefined, null, empty string, 0, NaN to a conditional statement, they are considered as false since they are falsy value.

## **Null vs Undefined**

Both are definitely falsy value but they are not the same type.Null types are defined as non-existence.On the other hand, Undefined types are not defined yet.

-   undefined— not defined yet, has no value
-   null — defined as non-existence, has value (null)

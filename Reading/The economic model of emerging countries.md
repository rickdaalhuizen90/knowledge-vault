# The economic model of emerging countries

## From the industrial revolution to global growth
- Before the industrial revolution the global economy experience almost no growth compared by the standards of today.
- After WW2 the income gap of developing economies narrowed.

## Information and asymmetric of the market
- Asymmetric information is when one party have more information then the other where one can financially benefit from.
- A solution to this is signaling, that's when the most informed party reveals information to the other party.

## The economy of developing countries
- Catch-up growth is when one is learning not by inventing things themselves but by learning from other developed countries.
- Examples of fast growing economies are: Japan, China, India, Korea, Taiwan, Hong-Kong, Singapore.
- The colonial empires fell apart after WWII. These colonial countries had built-in economic asymmetry, so they had an advantage over developing countries.
- The general agreement on tariffs and trade minimize the barriers to international trade by eliminating or reducing quotas, tariffs and subsidies.

## Africa and the "lacking" growth
- In the early days people thought that wealth was created by natural resources, what is not true.
- The basis of creating wealth and growth is people (human resources).
- Human capital is the stock of habits, knowledge, social and personality attributes embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value.
- Post-Colonial States struggle to find an unified identity to form a country.

## The phases of growth and the world economy
The **four** stages of the economic cycle are also referred to as the business cycle. These **four** stages are **expansion**, peak, contraction, and trough.

- Expansion is the phase of the business cycle where real GDP grows for two or more consecutive quarters, moving from a trough to a peak.
- A peak refers to the pinnacle point of economic growth in a business cycle before the market enters into a period of contraction.
- Contraction is when growth slows, employment falls, and prices stagnate.
- The trough of the cycle is reached when the economy hits a low point and growth begins to recover.

## China and the risks of the global economy
- The leadership transition will set the tone for socioeconomic reforms in China upcoming decades.
- The largest economies are: Europe, United States, China and Japan.

## The long march of the Chinese Giant
- 1945–**1949** — The Chinese Communist Revolution, known in the mainland China as the War of Liberation
- Mao Zedong opted for a market-oriented govern styled instead of a central planned economy.
- The Chinese Rural Reform (also called Agrarian Reform) was one of the many reforms that helped the Chinese economy to grow.

## The trap of average income
- Low wages make it possible for low income countries to compete, therefor it needs structural change.
- Low wages make it possible for low-income countries to compete, to create a larger middle income, structural change is needed.

## The difficult transition of emerging countries
- Growth is created with creating new things and destroying the old.
- To bring about reforms, China's labor-intensive work could potentially move to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.

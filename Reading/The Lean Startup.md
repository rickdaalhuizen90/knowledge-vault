| Entrepreneurs are everywhere   | The Startup approach can work in any size company                                                   |
| Entrepreneurship is management | A startup is an institution not a product                                                           |
| Validated learning             | Startup exist to _learn_ to build a sustainable business                                            |
| Pivot or persevere             | Change of strategy or continue our current path                                                     |
| Innovation accounting          | Focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, setup milestones, and how to prioritize work    |
| Build-Measure-Learn            | Turn ideas into products, measure how customers response, and then learn whether pivot or persevere |

### Summary
A startup is a way of working. Nor should it be seen as a product but an institution that is constantly learning. Progress must be measured and work must be prioritize.

| Cross-functional teams            | A group of people with different functional expertise working towards a common goal                                   |
| Engine of growth                  | Metrics that can help to figure out how to create sustainable growth based on customer use of your product or service |
| Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop | Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments             |

### Summary
The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing the build, the thing customers want and will pay for, as quickly as possible.

We don't need complex plans based on many assumptions. Instead, we can make small adjustments and learn when to pivot or persevere.

| Develop experimentation systems               | Killing the things that don't make sense and doubling down on the ones that do     |

### Summary
A startup is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop and validate a new product. While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, it also can happen inside a big company. Startups face high uncertainty, and needs to keep innovating to create sustainable path.

> Lean manufacturing: Learning to see waste and then systematically eliminate it

Validated learning is to understand what customers want, by getting insight through collecting empirical data. Productivity is being measured on effort that's value creating and not on what's waste full.
